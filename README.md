 Automate your mobsec flow
```

Mobile Pentest Assistant (MPA) is a toolkit designed to streamline and automate
your mobile security (mobsec) workflow. It simplifies and accelerates common
pentesting operations for mobile devices.

to run, execute `python3 mpa`.

## Requirements

- iOS:
  [libimobiledevice](https://libimobiledevice.org/),
  [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)
  - macOS - `brew install libimobiledevice`
  - Debian / Ubuntu / Kali - `apt install libimobiledevice`

- Android:
  [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb),
  [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

  - macOS - `brew install android-platform-tools scrcpy`
  - Debian / Ubuntu / Kali - `apt install android-tools-adb scrcpy`

- Python:
  [Frida](https://frida.re/)

  - Install all - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Separate packages - `pip install frida-tools`

## Notes

Quicktime is currently MacOS only for screen sharing, Linux will need a
different solution. Linux will need some work in general, as everything was
written on an ARM Mac so far.

I made a wrapper around `adb` because Python native solutions are incomplete:
`pure-python-adb`, e.g., has no `reverse`. `adb_shell` is wonky/has experimental
USB support.

Libimobiledevice does provide a python3 interface, but I saw no brew package for
this. So I decided to go the same route as Android for now, wrapping around the
programs, but this could be potentially improved in the future.

### Roadmap

- [x] detect devices
- [x] screen mirroring
- [ ] shell/command
  - [x] Android
  - [ ] iOS
- [ ] HTTP(s) redirect
  - [x] Android
  - [ ] iOS
    - [ ] Install generated MPA SSH certificate on idevice.
          As SSH is used for shell, mitm, etc.
    - [ ] Storage (sqlite?)
          JSON was a temporary hack, we can do better.
- [ ] certificate install/enablement
  - [ ] Android
  - [ ] iOS
- [ ] menu to select action
- [ ] command line interface
- [ ] first time run show license info
- [ ] Frida
  - [x] detection
  - [ ] installation/version check
- [ ] custom scripting/modules
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!
